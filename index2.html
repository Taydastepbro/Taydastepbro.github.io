    <img src="img/burger.jpg" alt="my burger" width="600" height="450" />
        <p>Cooper's Hawk Winery & Resturants is a local favorite I enjoy visiting for the legendary Leonard Burger.Crafted from the most delicious cuts of beef, this burger is a double patty American classic. Paired with fries you can't go wrong. What about your wine parings? I'm glad you asked!!! I dare not visit a winery and not indulge in adult beverages. By no means am I a wine consonnoissuur however, I dabble in a sip sip horray every now and again. The day's selection was a flight consisting of a Sweet Red, Mosocto, Rhubarb, and Blueberry each feeling like juice with a life of experience.  </p>
    <h2>Tupelo Honey</h2>
        <p2>After my FIFTH time at tupelo honey I could find no flaws.Tupelo honey gives you the apperance of upscale dining but what you recieve is southern comfort. I enjoy there Mac-N-Cheese Waffles with Asheville Hot fried chicken but with the non spicy options for chicken. For my drink I order ofcourse a sweet peach tea that reminds me of my home state Georgia.  </p2>
